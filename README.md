**Title:** My First dApp

**Description:**
This project represents a simple decentralized application (dApp) for setting and getting moods. It utilizes the Ethereum blockchain for its backend functionality and is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Features:**
1. **UI Design:** The dApp has a user-friendly interface designed with HTML and styled with CSS. It includes a header, input field, buttons for setting and getting moods, and a display area.
2. **Blockchain Integration:** The dApp interacts with the Ethereum blockchain to store and retrieve mood data. It uses the ethers.js library to connect to the Ethereum network, interact with smart contracts, and execute transactions.
3. **Smart Contract:** The dApp interacts with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract includes functions for setting and getting moods, which are called through the dApp interface.
4. **Responsive Design:** The dApp is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

**Dependencies:**
- The dApp requires an Ethereum wallet extension (e.g., MetaMask) installed in the web browser to connect to the Ethereum network. Sepolia is the test network. 

**Compatibility:**
- The dApp is compatible with modern web browsers that support JavaScript and the Ethereum wallet extension.

**Credits:**
- Dependencies:
  - ethers.js (v5.7.2): https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/
